# 🌱 Object-Oriented Harvesting Systems

## 📌 Description

`Object-Oriented Harvesting Systems` is an algorithmic and architectural project in **Python** focused on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The goal is to build an exhaustive garden management system that evolves from basic script structures to complex digital ecosystems.

This project challenges your ability to model real-world systems, protect data integrity through encapsulation, and design scalable software architectures using advanced inheritance and class management.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implementation of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Data Integrity & Security:** Encapsulation using custom getters/setters and input validation.
- **Software Architecture:** Designing scalable systems with nested components and class factories.
- **Advanced Python Features:** Mastery of `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and `super()`.
- **Code Quality:** Strict adherence to `flake8` standards, Type Hinting, and Docstrings.
- **System Simulation:** Modeling autonomous behaviors and complex data relationships.

## 🌳 Project Roadmap

- **ex0: Garden Intro** – Program entry points and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern.
- **ex1: Data Organizer** – Initial class modeling and efficient data structures.
- **ex2: Growth Simulator** – Implementing instance methods for state changes over time.
- **ex3: Plant Factory** – Optimizing mass object creation and initialization.
- **ex4: Security System** – Protecting sensitive data from corruption and invalid states.
- **ex5: Specialized Types** – Advanced inheritance for Flowers, Trees, and Vegetables.
- **ex6: Analytics Platform** – High-level management using class-level logic and nested tools.

## ⚙️ Execution

Each exercise is self-contained and must be executed from its respective directory:

```bash
# Example: Running the Garden Security System
python3 ex4/ft_garden_security.py
